Custom integration of Leaflet with React — minimal, flexible, and extensible.

**react-leafletts** offers a clean bridge between React’s declarative UI and Leaflet’s powerful mapping engine, without relying on `react-leaflet`. It combines a class-based core for Leaflet logic with composable React components.

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ Full control over **Leaflet** maps via clean abstraction
- ⚛️ **React-first API** with components like `<Map>`, `<TileLayer>`, `<Marker>`, etc.
- 💡 **Headless + declarative**: UI state is managed through React props/context
- 🧱 **Atomic Design** + **Clean Architecture** ready
- 🚀 Lightweight: No extra dependencies beyond `leaflet` and `react`
